# Description
This project was requested by the staff at Monarch Dentistry. This project aims to decrease the time staff spend managing dental equipment with the use of QR codes, and provide an easy to use interface that allows for updating inventory and orders. I built this project using the MERN tech stack, deployed the backend on Heroku and the frontend on Netlify.
